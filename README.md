# Bug or Bad choises
- perhaps the extract.....Bots, like ExtractAccountsFromHastagBot or ExtractFollowersBot, that extends sssbot make a 'fake' override of stop() method because of the extract process that can't be stopped
- developed for fun when I had no knowledge of software engineering yet

# Developer
